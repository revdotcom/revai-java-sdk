An orange is a fruit of various citrus species in the family Rutaceae it primarily refers to Citrus sinensis, which is also called sweet orange, to distinguish it from the related Citrus aurantium, referred to as bitter orange. The sweet orange reproduces asexually varieties of sweet orange arise through mutations. The orange is a hybrid between pomelo (Citrus maxima) and mandarin (Citrus reticulata). The chloroplast genome, and therefore the maternal line, is that of pomelo. The sweet orange has had its full genome sequenced.[2]
